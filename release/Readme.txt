INSTALLATION
--------------------------

If you used the zip archive to install the plugin you have to extract the contents of the zip to the MusicBee plugins
 folder. Usually this is the C:\Program Files (x86)\MusicBee\Plugins\.
 
If you use the installer then this will be done automatically for you but you might need to use the archive for the 
Windows Store version or for a portable installations. 

The plugin contains the following files:

- mb_remote.dll - The MusicBee Remote plugin 
- firewall-utility.exe - A helper utility to update the Firewall rules on windows when you change the listening port
- LICENSE - The application license (GPLv3)
- Readme.txt - This readme file

UNINSTALLATION
--------------------------
If you installed using the installer there should be an uninstaller that takes care of this for you.

Otherwise locate the files mentioned above and delete them.

In non-portable installations, the application stores it's data under the %APPDATA%\MusicBee\mb_remote\.
If you want to clear the state you also have to delete this folder.
